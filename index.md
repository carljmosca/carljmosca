## Carl J. Mosca

### Experience

I first learned to program in BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) at the age of 12 which was in the mid 1970's.  Since then, I have used a number of programming languages on a variety of technology stacks.  Hardware includes single board computers, micros, minis, mainframes, along with a variety of specialized devices and peripherals.

I am an Enterprise Architect by day but still find time to write code both for the enjoyment and to stay engaged in more than on area of IT.

### Current Interests

Cloud technologies occupy a good bit of my time reading, writing, and architecting solutions.  I still love Java and am fascinated that browser-based technologies and development continues to mature.  Or, put another way, I am happy to see that JavaScript (along with TypeScript) no longer drives me crazy or at least as much as it once did.
