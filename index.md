### Development

I first learned to program in BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) at the age of 12 which was in the mid 1970's.  Since then, I have used a number of programming languages on a variety of technology stacks.  Hardware includes single board computers, micros, minis, mainframes, along with a variety of specialized devices and peripherals.
